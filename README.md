# LSTM-Based Stock Price Forecasting
A web application that predicts stock price trends using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. This project uses historical stock data and visualizes both actual and predicted prices to help investors analyze stock trends.

## Demo

Enter a stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL`, `GOOGL`, `TSLA`) in the Streamlit web app to view:

- Raw closing price data
- 100-day and 200-day moving averages
- LSTM model prediction vs actual prices
- Model perfromance
